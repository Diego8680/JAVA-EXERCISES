/*
Exercise 2: Write a Java program to calculate the revenue from a sale based on the unit price and quantity of a product input by the user.

The discount rate is 10% for the quantity purchased between 100 and 120 units, and 15% for the quantity purchased greater than 120 units. 
If the quantity purchased is less than 100 units, the discount rate is 0%. See the example output as shown below:
Enter unit price: 25

Enter quantity: 110

The revenue from sale: 2475.0$

After discount: 275.0$(10.0%)
